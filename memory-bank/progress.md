## Current Status

### Completed ‚úÖ
1. **Project Requirements Analysis**: Full understanding of PRD specifications
2. **Memory Bank Creation**: Comprehensive project documentation
3. **Technical Architecture Design**: System patterns and component relationships
4. **Technology Stack Selection**: React + Node.js + MongoDB confirmed
5. **Development Approach**: API-first, component-driven strategy defined

### In Progress üîÑ
- **Project Setup Phase**: Ready to begin implementation
- **Environment Preparation**: Prerequisites identified and documented

### Blocked ‚è∏Ô∏è
- None currently - all dependencies can be setup in parallel

## Known Issues

### Potential Challenges
1. **Instagram API Approval**: Meta Developer app approval may take time
2. **Webhook Testing**: Requires ngrok setup for local development
3. **Rate Limiting**: Instagram API limits may affect testing frequency
4. **Token Management**: Complex refresh logic for long-running automation

### Risk Mitigation Plans
1. **API Approval Delay**: Start with mock data and simulate webhook events
2. **Webhook Complexity**: Use ngrok early and document setup process
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement queue system from start, not as afterthought
4. **Token Issues**: Build robust error handling and user notification system

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Assumptions Validated
- **Keyword-based approach**: Simpler than AI, more predictable for users
- **Single account MVP**: Reduces complexity while proving concept
- **Local MongoDB**: Avoids cloud dependencies and costs for MVP
- **Admin-only registration**: Simplifies user management for initial launch

### Technical Decisions Refined
- **Monorepo structure**: Easier development and deployment coordination
- **WebSocket for dashboard**: Real-time updates essential for user confidence
- **Queue-based processing**: Critical for handling Instagram API rate limits
- **Fallback comment system**: Essential for private account limitations

### Scope Clarifications
- **MVP Focus**: Comments and DMs only, no story mentions or other events
- **Text-only responses**: No media attachments in automated responses
- **Business accounts only**: Aligns with Instagram API requirements
- **Manual keyword setup**: No AI-suggested keywords in MVP

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Target 80% for core business logic
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for internal APIs
- **Build Time**: <30 seconds for frontend, <10 seconds for backend
- **Test Suite Runtime**: <2 minutes for full test suite

### User Experience Metrics (Post-Launch)
- **Onboarding Time**: <5 minutes target
- **Response Time**: <5 seconds from comment to reply
- **Success Rate**: 90% automation success target
- **User Retention**: Weekly active user tracking

### System Performance Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99% availability target
- **Throughput**: >1000 requests/day capacity
- **Error Rate**: <1% for critical operations
- **Recovery Time**: <5 minutes for system issues

## Next Immediate Actions

### Priority 1 (This Week)
1. Initialize project structure with frontend and backend directories
2. Setup basic Express.js server with MongoDB connection
3. Create React app with Vite and basic routing
4. Configure development environment and scripts

### Priority 2 (Next Week)
1. Implement JWT authentication system
2. Build keyword matching and response engine
3. Setup Instagram webhook endpoints
4. Create basic dashboard UI

### Priority 3 (Week 3)
1. Complete Instagram API integration
2. Build post management interface
3. Implement real-time dashboard updates
4. Add comprehensive error handling

## Development Velocity Tracking

### Estimated Effort Distribution
- **Backend Development**: 40% of total effort
- **Frontend Development**: 35% of total effort
- **Instagram Integration**: 15% of total effort
- **Testing & Documentation**: 10% of total effort

### Risk Factors for Timeline
- **Instagram API complexity**: May require additional time for edge cases
- **Webhook reliability**: Testing and debugging webhook events
- **UI/UX refinement**: Dashboard usability may need iterations
- **Performance optimization**: Queue and rate limiting fine-tuning

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Parallel development**: Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously
- **Mock data approach**: Don't wait for Instagram API approval to start
- **Incremental testing**: Test each component as it's built
- **User feedback loops**: Early UI mockups for validation
