2. **Webhook Testing**: Requires ngrok setup for local development
3. **Rate Limiting**: Instagram API limits may affect testing frequency
4. **Token Management**: Complex refresh logic for long-running automation

### Risk Mitigation Plans
1. **API Approval Delay**: Start with mock data and simulate webhook events
2. **Webhook Complexity**: Use ngrok early and document setup process
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement queue system from start, not as afterthought
4. **Token Issues**: Build robust error handling and user notification system

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Assumptions Validated
- **Keyword-based approach**: Simpler than AI, more predictable for users
- **Single account MVP**: Reduces complexity while proving concept
- **Local MongoDB**: Avoids cloud dependencies and costs for MVP
- **Admin-only registration**: Simplifies user management for initial launch

### Technical Decisions Refined
- **Monorepo structure**: Easier development and deployment coordination
- **WebSocket for dashboard**: Real-time updates essential for user confidence
- **Queue-based processing**: Critical for handling Instagram API rate limits
- **Fallback comment system**: Essential for private account limitations

### Scope Clarifications (Updated from PRD)
- **MVP Focus**: Comments and DMs only, no story mentions or other events
- **Text-only responses**: No media attachments in automated responses
- **Business accounts only**: Aligns with Instagram API requirements
- **Manual keyword setup**: No AI-suggested keywords in MVP
