# Product Context: Tanggapin

## Why This Project Exists

### Business Problem
SMEs and content creators face a critical bottleneck in customer engagement on Instagram:
- High volume of comments and DMs during promotions overwhelm manual response capacity
- Delayed responses lead to lost sales opportunities
- Inconsistent messaging affects brand perception
- Time-intensive manual management prevents focus on content creation and business growth

### Market Opportunity
- Instagram is a primary sales channel for SMEs and creators
- Automated customer service is becoming standard expectation
- Gap exists between enterprise-level automation tools and affordable SME solutions

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Quick Setup**: User logs in, connects Instagram account, selects posts for automation
2. **Smart Configuration**: Define keywords and corresponding responses for each post
3. **Automated Engagement**: System monitors selected posts and responds instantly to matching keywords
4. **Intelligent Fallback**: When DMs fail (private accounts), system posts public comment with link
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Dashboard shows response rates, popular keywords, and engagement metrics

### Core User Journey
```
User posts product → Sets up keywords → Customer comments → 
System detects keyword → Sends DM with product link → 
If DM fails → Posts fallback comment → Logs activity
```

### Key User Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Product Launch
- Creator posts new product reel
- Sets keywords: "price", "buy", "link", "order"
- Customers comment asking about purchase
- System instantly DMs product link and pricing
- Fallback comment directs to bio link if DM fails

#### Scenario 2: Promotion Campaign
- SME runs limited-time offer
- Keywords: "discount", "promo", "sale"
- High comment volume during campaign
- Automated responses maintain engagement
- Dashboard tracks conversion metrics

#### Scenario 3: FAQ Management
- Common questions about shipping, sizes, availability
- Preset responses with relevant information
- Reduces repetitive manual responses
- Maintains consistent brand voice

## Problems It Solves

2. **Scalability**: Handles unlimited comments/DMs without additional human resources
3. **Consistency**: Ensures uniform brand messaging across all interactions
