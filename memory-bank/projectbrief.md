# Project Brief: Tanggapin

## Project Overview
Tanggapin is a web-based auto-reply application for Instagram, designed specifically for SMEs and content creators to automatically respond to comments and direct messages based on keyword detection.

## Core Problem
SMEs and content creators struggle to manage high volumes of Instagram comments and DMs, especially during product promotions. Manual responses are time-consuming and often lead to missed opportunities for customer engagement and sales conversion.

## Solution
An automated system that:
- Detects keywords in Instagram comments and DMs
- Sends appropriate automated responses
- Directs potential buyers to correct product links
- Provides fallback mechanisms when direct messaging fails
- Offers comprehensive monitoring and reporting

## Project Scope
**Included:**
- Instagram-only support (MVP)
- Automatic reply to public comments & DMs
- Customizable reply text and keywords
- Dashboard for monitoring and reporting
- Quick automation interface

**Excluded:**
- WhatsApp, TikTok, Facebook integration
- AI-based replies (keyword-based only)
- Multi-account support (single Instagram account only)

## Success Criteria
- 90% of comments/DMs responded to within 5 seconds
- Automated DM and fallback system functioning reliably
- Dashboard with comprehensive logs and statistics
- User onboarding completed in under 5 minutes

## Timeline
4-week development cycle with weekly milestones

## Target Users
- SMEs and small brands
- Content creators with high engagement
- Social media admins for online stores/communities

## Key Constraints
- Instagram Business Account required (linked to Facebook Page)
